# Operational Dashboards with Grafana

We use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for creating dashboards
from our [metrics](../metrics.html). Dashboards are useful for
understanding the current status of the system and all its components
at a glance. They are also very useful to try and debug what
is going wrong during / after an outage.

## What is it?

```eval_rst

```

A dashboard is a set of pre-defined graphs in a particular layout that
provide an overview of a system. In our case, they provide an overview
of the [operational metrics](../metrics.html) of the components that make
up mybinder.org.

## Where is it?

Our dashboards are at [grafana.mybinder.org](https://grafana.mybinder.org).
It is public for everyone to view - but to edit, you need an admin password
that is private. Open an issue in [jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy)
if you want write access to the dashboards.

You can click the button to the right of the Grafana logo in the top left,
and it will open a drop-down menu of dashboards for the mybinder.org deployment.

## Modifying dashboards

Each dashboard is edited directly from the user interface (if you have
access to edit it). You can click on any graph and select the `Edit` option
to see what queries make up the dashboard, and how you can edit it.
All the dashboard definitions are stored in an `sqlite` database on a
disk attached to the running grafana instance.

The [Grafana documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/basic_concepts/)
has more info on the various concepts in Grafana, and how you can use them.
You can also create a new dashboard and play with it. Be careful before
editing currently used dashboards!

## Installation & Configuration

Grafana is installed with the [Grafana helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana).
You can see the options for configuring it documented in its
[`values.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/blob/master/stable/grafana/values.yaml)
file. You can also see the specific ways we have configured it
in the `grafana` section of `mybinder/values.yaml`, `config/prod.yaml`
and `config/staging.yaml`.

## Annotations

[Annotations](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/annotations/) are
a cool feature of Grafana that lets us add arbitrary markers tagged to
all graphs marking an event that has happened. For example, you can
create an annotation each time a deployment happens - this puts a
marker with info about the deployment on each graph, so you can easily
tell if a particular deployment has caused changes in any metric.
This is very useful for debugging!

We use the script in `travis/post-grafana-annotation.py` to
create annotations just before each deployment. See the docstring in
the script for more details.
