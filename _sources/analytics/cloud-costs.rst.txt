Cloud Costs Data
================

In an effort to be transparent about how we use our funds,
we publish the amount of money spent each day in cloud
compute costs for running mybinder.org.

Interpreting the data
=====================

You can find the data in the `Analytics Archive
<https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org>`_ at `cloud-costs.jsonl
<https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org/cloud-costs.jsonl>`_. Each line in
the file is a JSON object, with the following keys:

#. **version**

   Currently *1*, will be incremented when the structure of this format
   changes.

#. **start_time** and **end_time**

   The start and end of the billing period this item represents. These
   times are inclusive, and in pacific time observing DST (so PDT or PST).
   The timezone choice is unfortunate, but unfortunately our cloud provider
   (Google Cloud Platform) provides detailed billing reports in this timezone
   only.

#. **cost**

   The cost of all cloud compute resources used during this time period. This
   is denominated in US Dollars.

The lines are sorted by ``start_time``.
