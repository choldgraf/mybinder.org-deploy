What is the mybinder.org operations team?
-----------------------------------------

Behind the mybinder.org deployment is a team of contributors that
donate their time to keeping mybinder.org running smoothly. This
role is often called a
`Site Reliability Engineer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering>`_.
(or SRE). We informally call this team the "mybinder.org operators".

This site is a collection of wisdom, tools, and other helpful information that the
mybinder.org operations team uses for maintenance and team-processes
around the BinderHub deployment at `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_.
